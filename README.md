The first feature of Pear Music is its album browsing capabilities. Users can easily navigate through a variety of albums in the main file, making it easy to discover new music. The search function also allows users to find specific albums by name.

Another feature is the ability to add albums to a personal playlist. By hovering over the album art, users can click on a button to add a selected album to their playlist. This allows users to curate a custom collection of albums to listen to. 

In addition to the browsing and playlist features, Pear Music also has a top album page. This page displays a random selection of 12 albums, making it easy to discover new music that you might not have found on your own. 

For those who want to contribute, there is also an "add new album" feature. This allows users to add new albums to the database, expanding the platform's already impressive collection of music.
