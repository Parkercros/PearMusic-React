Pear Music is a parody of Apple Music. 

To view you're going to need to run NPM Start.
The database is hosted online and is decently sized, so it may take a moment to fully load.

The first feature of Pear Music is its album browsing capabilities. Users can easily navigate through a variety of albums in the main file, making it easy to discover new music. The search function also allows users to find specific albums by name.

Another feature is the ability to add albums to a personal playlist. By hovering over the album art, users can click on a button to add a selected album to their playlist. This allows users to curate a custom collection of albums to listen to. Users can also can localy delete an album from the database by using the delete button.

In addition to the browsing and playlist features, Pear Music also has a top album page. This page displays a random selection of 12 albums, making it easy to discover new music that you might not have found on your own. 

The sorting dropdown allows you to sort in either assending or decending order. You can choose between Artist name, Album name, and release year.

For those who want to contribute, there is also an "add new album" feature. This allows users to add new albums to the database, expanding the platform's already impressive collection of music.

The Top music component houses the controlls for a handfull of songs. Users can skip, pause, play, and go back to a previous song. The progress bar shows the current part of the song, and by clicking on it you are able to jump to specific parts of a song. The volume butten is also functional.
